Fractal Puzzles

fractals.c that will generate the fractal shapes attached. The program will first open a large blank window and wait for user input. When the user presses any of the keys 1 through 8, the program will clear the screen, and then draw the corresponding fractal shape. Then, for each new number key (1-8) pressed, that fractal will be displayed. The program exits when the user presses 'q'. For any other key pressed, nothing is displayed (blank screen).

Each fractal shape is drawn by a recursive function that stops recursing when the scale of drawing becomes too small.
